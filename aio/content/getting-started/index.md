# Getting Started with Angular: Your First App

Angular is the modern web developer's platform. 
Angular gives you the tools and the ecosystem to build web applications that scale. 
Angular provides advanced capabilities for internationalization, mobile apps, server-side rendering, and more, so that you can deliver more quickly, with less risk. 

In this tutorial, we'll introduce you to the building blocks of Angular. We'll leverage what you already know about web development, and teach you the essentials of Angular so you can begin exploring Angular's native capabilities and its extensive [network of 3rd-party tools and libraries](https://angular.io/resources). 

## Introduction

This tutorial walks you through the steps to build a simple shopping cart application.
The application displays a catalog of products, and lets users select products to put in their carts.

</figure>

*JAF: Replace with image of this tutorial's final app. Mention Google Express?*

You don't need to install anything. You'll build the shopping cart using [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/). StackBlitz is an online development environment with accelerators that make it easy to develop an Angular application. 


{@a intro-tutorial}
### What you'll learn
<!-- Tutorial application -->

This first part takes about an hour to complete. In that hour, you'll create the catalog part of the application. You'll learn about:

* Components, which are the building blocks of an Angular application
* Angular's template syntax, which extends HTML to provide integration with data and services
* How to use services to deliver data to components
* How to use routing to synchronize URL changes and app changes in response to user actions 

You can then choose to continue to extend the app to add the shopping cart feature. You'll learn about: 

* Data: Managing external data and using services to keep data in sync
* Architecture: 
    - Scaling your app by using ngModules to control (compilation context?)
    - Improving performance by using lazy loading

Finally, you can deploy your app to a live website or to your local environment. If you chose to deploy to a local environment, you'll learn how to use the [Angular CLI](cli).


<div class="alert is-helpful">

The Angular CLI offers the same code-generation capability as the `Angular Generator` feature of StackBlitz, which you will use in this tutorial. 

</div>


{@a intro-skills}
### Recommended experience

To get the most benefit from Angular and this tutorial, we recommend that you have experience in the following areas: 

* Basic programming
* HTML, CSS, and JavaScript or TypeScript

This tutorial uses the [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/) library. We provide sufficient instruction for you to create the app, even if you don't have prior experience with [observables](guide/observables). 

*JAF: Let's talk about how to handle the RxJS/observables parts. We might want to teach them a bit, rather than expect* 

<div class="alert is-helpful">

If you are new to web development, you'll find there are lots of resources available to compliment the Angular docs. Mozilla's MDN docs include both [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML) and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript). [TypeScript's docs] (https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html) include a 5-minute tutorial. Various online course platforms, such as Udemy and CodeAcademy, also cover web development basics.

{@a components}
## Key concepts


{@a components}
### Components

An Angular application is composed of a tree of components. A component is the combination of three things: 

* An HTML template, which determines what is presented to the user
* A class that handles data and functionality
* Styles that define the look and feel 

This combination provides a consistent way to combine and present HTML, CSS, and Javascript on a page. 
Angular components behave similarly to HTML elements, and they can be given state or generate events.

You could create an entire application inside of a single component, but we recommend organizing an application into smaller components, each of which has fewer responsibilities. 
Ideally, each Angular component has a specific purpose and responsibility. 

Imagine a normal shopping experience, such as [Google Express](https://express.google.com): 

*JAF: Use the shopping cart that we'll build*

<figure>
  <img src='generated/images/guide/toh/component-structure.gif' alt="Angular applications are broken down into a tree of components like on express.google.com">
</figure>

You can organize this application into a tree of components:

* app-root: Root
  * app-top-bar: Top bar, with branding and site-wide controls
  * app-side-nav: Side navigation, which includes the list of departments and other site areas 
  * app-product-list: Product list 
    * app-product-carousel: Product carousel, which displays a rotating series of highlighted products
    * app-product-preview: Product preview, with basic information such as name and description
    * app-product-preview: Product preview
    * app-product-preview: Product preview
    * app-product-preview: Product preview
    
Components are referred to by their `selector`. The selector is the name you give the Angular component when it is rendered as an HTML element on the page. Just like HTML elements, components can be referred to or nested in another component's template. Angular provides template syntax that gives components control over the rendering of content.


{@a template-syntax}
### Template syntax

Angular extends and builds on top of HTML. This section highlights 5 things you can do within an Angular template to affect what your user sees, based on the component's state and behavior. 

Each of these descriptions includes an input box where you can experiment with different values. 

#### {{ }} Interpolation

Interpolation lets you render the contents of a property of your component as text in your HTML. 

<aio-gs-interpolation></aio-gs-interpolation>

#### [ ] Property binding

Following the mental model of HTML, components have state being given to them. This is accomplished by binding to the property of a component or HTML element.

*JAF: Not sure I understand the lead-in. You can bind a property so that whenever the value changes in the component, that new value appears on the screen. Should we mention two-way data binding?*

<aio-gs-property-binding></aio-gs-property-binding>

#### ( ) Event binding

You can listen to standard HTML events or custom events (which you create through components). 

<aio-gs-event-binding></aio-gs-event-binding>

#### *ngIf

You can add and remove elements from the page dynamically using an `NgIf` directive. `*ngIf` is known as a "structural directive" because it changes the structure of the HTML DOM. In other words, it changes which HTML or components are displayed (rendered) any given moment. 

Any directive with an * is called a structural directive and has similar functionality.

*JAF: Link to where they can learn more. Explain relationship between 'NgIf' in the API and *ngIf in the template.*

<aio-gs-ng-if></aio-gs-ng-if>

#### *ngFor

*ngFor is another structural directive that lets you iterate over a list, rendering the HTML or component once for each item in the list. 

<aio-gs-ng-for></aio-gs-ng-for>


<div class="alert is-helpful">

The [Angular Cheat Sheet](guide/cheatsheet) includes a summary of Angular's template syntax. 
To learn about the full capabilities of the template syntax, see the [Template Syntax guide](guide/template-syntax).

</div>


{@a basic-app}
## Building the basic shopping cart application
<!-- skeleton, framework, site layout, app layout -->

Let's get started. 

As mentioned above, you'll develop this tutorial application in the StackBlitz development environment. 

In this section, you'll create a new project in StackBlitz, and then scaffod out the components for your shopping cart.

You'll learn: 

* The parts of a component (typescript, html, and css files)
* How to use data defined in the component
* How to ??? 


#### 1. Create a new project
<!-- does this def of project match local def? when and how do we introduce workspace? -->
<!-- 
You develop apps in the context of an Angular workspace. A workspace contains the files for one or more projects. A project is the set of files that comprise an app, a library, or end-to-end (e2e) tests.  -->

To create a new project in StackBlitz, [click here](https://stackblitz.com/fork/ng-getting-started).

StackBlitz creates a new Angular project, based on a template that we created specifically for this tutorial. 

<div class="alert is-helpful">

StackBlitz also has a general starter project for any Angular app, which can then be exported to your local system and managed by the Angular CLI. 

</div>


#### 2. Generate the top bar component

1. Right click on the `app` folder and use the `Angular Generator` to generate a new component named `top-bar`.

<code-tabs>

  <code-pane header="src/app/top-bar/top-bar.component.ts" path="getting-started/src/app/top-bar/top-bar.component.ts" region="v1">
  </code-pane>

  <code-pane header="src/app/top-bar/top-bar.component.html" path="getting-started/src/app/top-bar/top-bar.component.html" region="initial">
  </code-pane>

  <code-pane header="src/app/top-bar/top-bar.component.css" path="getting-started/src/app/top-bar/top-bar.component.css">
  </code-pane>

</code-tabs>

Every component has distinct pieces.

 * The `Component` decorator that provides metadata about the component, including its templates, styles, and a selector.
 * An exported class that handles functionality for the component.

Right now, the `TopBarComponent` doesn't do much, but you'll update it to show the name of your store.

2. Define a `name` property to the `TopBarComponent` class with a value of `My Store`.

<code-example header="src/app/top-bar/top-bar.component.ts" path="getting-started/src/app/top-bar/top-bar.component.ts" region="name">
</code-example>

3. Update the `TopBarComponent` template to display a welcome message with an interpolation of the `name` property.

<code-example header="src/app/top-bar/top-bar.component.html" path="getting-started/src/app/top-bar/top-bar.component.html" region="header">
</code-example>

4. Replace the contents of your `app.component.html` with the `app-top-bar` component.

<code-example header="src/app/app.component.html" path="getting-started/src/app/app.component.1.html" linenums="false" region="top-bar">
</code-example>

Now your shopping cart displays the title of your store at the top of your application.

#### 3. Create the side nav component

The side navigation lists categories for the products in your store.

1. Right click on the `app` folder, using the `Angular Generator`, generate a component named `side-nav`.
2. Define a `categories` property in the `SideNavComponent` as an array with two items: `Phones` and `Shoes`.

<code-example header="src/app/side-nav/side-nav.component.ts" path="getting-started/src/app/side-nav/side-nav.component.ts">
</code-example> 

3. Update the `side-nav.component.html` to display a list of categories using an `NgFor` directive.

<code-example header="src/app/side-nav/side-nav.component.html" path="getting-started/src/app/side-nav/side-nav.component.html" linenums="false">
</code-example>

4. To position the category names on the left side of the page, add the following styles in the `side-nav.component.css` file.

<code-example header="src/app/side-nav/side-nav.component.css" path="getting-started/src/app/side-nav/side-nav.component.css" linenums="false">
</code-example>

<div class="alert is-helpful">

The styles that are defined for a component are specific to that component. 
They do not impact the styles of other components in the application. 

For more information about styling components, see the [Component Styles guide](guide/component-styles).

</div>

5. Add the `app-side-nav` component to your `app.component.html` under the `app-top-bar` component.

<code-example header="src/app/app.component.html" path="getting-started/src/app/app.component.1.html" linenums="false" region="side-nav">
</code-example>

The `app-side-nav` component displays on the left side of the page, under the top bar.

## Communcating between components

Just like any element in HTML, Angular components take state, and emit events. You achieve these by creating Inputs and Outputs as properties in the component class. `Input` and `Output` are decorators provided by Angular that provide metadata for properties that are defined in the component class. These decorators with Angular's change detection system to communicate when changes occur from within a component and when the component conveys that some interesting event has happened.

### Providing state with an input

Below is an example of a component used to display a name.

```ts
import { Component, Input } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  template: `
    <div>{{name}}</div>
  `
})
export class EditableNameComponent {
  @Input() name: string;
}
```

Inputs define what data can be passed into your component. This data is updated through `bindings`, defined in a parent component's template. Whenever a parent component's property binding is updated, the property you mark with `@Input()` will also be updated as a part of Angular's change detection. In the example above, the `name` property is updated when the parent component updates the `name` through a binding.

### External communication with an output

Look at the `editName` property to see how the component communicates externally.

```ts
import { Component, Input, Output } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  template: `
    <div>{{name}}</div>

    <button (click)="editName.emit()">Edit</button>
  `
})
export class EditableNameComponent {
  @Input() name: string;
  @Output() editName = new EventEmitter();
}
```

Outputs are used to create custom events in your component. You create a new `EventEmitter` and store it as an `@Output()` property of the component. This newly created `EventEmitter` instance has a method `emit` that you call whenever your custom event has occurred, in response to some action from the template, or based on some asynchronous process.

With inputs and outputs, you build elaborate tree structures of components that take in state, and give back events using property and event bindings. Read more about these bindings in the [Template Syntax Guide](guide/template-syntax).

### Displaying a product preview

The steps below show you how to use an `Input` to display details for a single product.

#### 1. Create a products folder

Right click on the `app` folder and create a new folder named `products`. This folder will contain the relevant functionality for the `products` feature area.

#### 2. Create a product interface

Right click on the `products` folder, use the `Angular Generator` to generate an interface named `product`. 

<code-example header="src/app/products/product.ts" path="getting-started/src/app/products/product.1.ts">
</code-example>

This interface defines the structure of a product, including its name, description, and other details as needed. It also provides you a consistent way to reference a `Product` throughout your application.

#### 3. Create a product preview component

1. Right click on the `products` folder and generate a new component named `product-preview`.
2. In the `ProductPreviewComponent` class, add `Input` to the imports from the `@angular/core` package.

<code-example header="src/app/products/product-preview/product-preview.component.ts" path="getting-started/src/app/products/product-preview/product-preview.component.ts" region="core-imports">
</code-example>

3. Import the `Product` interface using its path relative to the `product-preview` folder.

<code-example header="src/app/products/product-preview/product-preview.component.ts" path="getting-started/src/app/products/product-preview/product-preview.component.ts" region="product-imports">
</code-example>

4. Define a property in the `ProductPreviewComponent` class named `product` and use the `Input` decorator on it. Give the `product` a define type using the `Product` interface.

<code-example header="src/app/products/product-preview/product-preview.component.ts" path="getting-started/src/app/products/product-preview/product-preview.component.ts" region="inputs-outputs">
</code-example>

When the `app-product-preview` component is used within a template and its `product` property is updated, change detection will be run on the component with the new data being displayed.

5. Update the `ProductPreviewComponent` template to display the data received from the `Input`.

<code-example header="src/app/products/product-preview/product-preview.component.html (Product Input)" path="getting-started/src/app/products/product-preview/product-preview.component.1.html">
</code-example>

6. Test the `app-product-preview` component and provide a product with its name and description.

<code-example header="src/app/app.component.1.html (Sample Preview)" path="getting-started/src/app/app.component.1.html" linenums="false" region="product-preview">
</code-example>

The `app-product-preview` component displays a single product with the product name and description.

## Storing data with services

Services are an integral part of Angular applications. Services in Angular are an instance of a class that can be made available to any part of your application using Angular's dependency injection system.

Services are used to encapsulate data and functionality.

### Creating and providing a service

To create a service, simply create a class and decorate it with `@Injectable()`.

```ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class MyService {}
```

The service now has defined metadata used for requesting an instance of the service. The `providedIn: 'root'` or `Tree-shakable provider` syntax provides the Angular compiler information to register the provider globally within Angular's dependency injection.

Learn more about Angular's dependency injection system in the [Dependency Injection guide](guide/dependency-injection).

Before you use a service, you must make sure it is provided in your application. 

Services necessary for your application functionality are often provided automatically using the `providedIn` metadata as part of the `@Injectable` decorator. 

3rd party services provide services through their `NgModule` definition that you import into your application. 

<div class="alert is-important">

An `NgModule` is a class marked by the `@NgModule` decorator. An `@NgModule` describes how to compile a component's template and how to create an injector at runtime. You don't need to focus much on how an `NgModule` works for this guide, but you can learn more about them in the [NgModules guide](guide/ngmodules).

</div>

Angular's HttpClient is an example of how a service is provided through an `NgModule`. To use the `NgModule`, import `HttpClientModule` from the `@angular/common/http` package.

```ts
import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';
```

Then add the `HttpClientModule` to your `AppModule` imports to register its providers globally in your application.

```ts
@NgModule({
  imports: [
    // Other imports ...
    HttpClientModule
  ]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Once the `HttpClientModule` is registered, the `HttpClient` service can be accessed anywhere in your application.

### Injecting services

To access a service, you import its type from a package or import path.

```ts
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
```

Once the type is imported, supply it to the constructor of your component, service, or `NgModule`.

```ts
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class MyDataService {
  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}
}
```

This is called "injecting" a service and adds it to the properties on the class. Anywhere in the class you can now refer to the service directly by the name you gave it. Read more about Angular's `HttpClient` in the [HttpClient Guide](guide/http).

### Creating a product service to store products

Services are the place where you share data between parts of your application. For the shopping cart, a product service is where you to store your product data and methods.

#### 1. Update the product interface

Update the `Product` interface in the `product.ts` file with more properties about a given product, 
such as its id, price, and categories.

<code-example header="src/app/products/product.ts (Product interface)" path="getting-started/src/app/products/product.ts" linenums="false">
</code-example>


#### 2. Generate the product service

Right click on the the `products` folder, use the `Angular Generator` to generate a service name `Product`.

<code-example header="src/app/products/product.service.ts (Initial code)" path="getting-started/src/app/products/product.service.1.ts">
</code-example>

#### 3. Import the observable and product types

To get the type information for an observable, import the `Observable` type. Import the `of` method from the RxJS library to create an observable from a predefined value.

<code-example header="src/app/products/product.service.ts (RxJS imports)" path="getting-started/src/app/products/product.service.2.ts" linenums="false" region="rxjs-imports">
</code-example>

<div class="alert is-helpful">

Angular integrates with the popular open-source library [Reactive Extensions for Javascript](https://rxjs.dev)(RxJS), which uses [observables](guide/glossary#observable) to handle asynchronous behavior in your application. Learn more about observable streams in Angular's [Observables guide](guide/observables).

</div>

Here you are importing the `of` method that creates and returns an observable. Later, you will use this method to return an observable array of products.



<div class="alert is-important">



</div>

Import the `Product` interface.

<code-example header="src/app/products/product.service.ts (Product interface)" path="getting-started/src/app/products/product.service.2.ts" linenums="false" region="product-import">
</code-example>

#### 3. Define data properties and methods

Use methods to expose the data from the `ProductService.data` property.

1. Define a `data` property in the `ProductService` class that contains product list data.
2. Add a `getAll()` method using the `of` method to return the products from the data property.

<code-example header="src/app/products/product.service.ts (Product Data)" path="getting-started/src/app/products/product.service.2.ts" region="product-data">
</code-example>

The `ProductService` is ready to be injected into many different areas in your application using Angular's dependency injection.

### Displaying the product list using a service

The data for the products is stored in a service accessible from components and other services. The products list component displays a listing of each product available in your store with a brief description.

#### 1. Generate the product list component

1. Right click on the `products` folder, use the `Angular Generator` to generate a component named `product-list`.

#### 2. Import the observable and product types

1. Import the `Observable` type from the `RxJS` library.

<code-example header="src/app/products/product-list/product-list.component.ts (Observable import)" path="getting-started/src/app/products/product-list/product-list.component.ts" region="rxjs-import">
</code-example>

2. Import the `ProductService` that provides the product data, and the `Product` interface.

<code-example header="src/app/products/product-list/product-list.component.ts (Product imports)" path="getting-started/src/app/products/product-list/product-list.component.ts" region="product-imports">
</code-example>

#### 3. Define the products and inject the product service

1. Define a `products` property in the `ProductListComponent` as an observable array of products.
2. Inject the `ProductService` into the constructor of the `ProductListComponent` and define the `products` using the `getAll()` method from the `ProductService`.

<code-example header="src/app/products/product-list/product-list.component.ts (Products Observable)" path="getting-started/src/app/products/product-list/product-list.component.ts" region="products-observable">
</code-example>

#### 4. Display the product list

To wire up the product data in the component template, you'll need to subscribe and listen to the values from the `products` observable. This is done in the component template using an `AsyncPipe` that handles subscribing to observables in the template and cleaning up after the component is destroyed.

1. Update the `product-list.component.html` to display the products using an `NgFor` directive, an `AsyncPipe`, and the `app-product-preview` component. 

<code-example header="src/app/products/product-list/product-list.component.html (Product List)" path="getting-started/src/app/products/product-list/product-list.component.html">
</code-example>

The `AsyncPipe` used in the template subscribes to the `products` observable that emits the array of products. The `NgFor` directive iterates over each product and binds a `product` to an `app-product-preview` component. Learn more about pipes in the [Pipes Guide](guide/pipes).

2. Add the `app-product-list` component to your `app.component.html` below the `app-side-nav` component.

<code-example header="src/app/app.component.html (Product List)" path="getting-started/src/app/app.component.1.html" region="product-list">
</code-example>


{@a routing}
## Navigating with the Angular router

Up to this point, the application doesn't have any variable states or navigation. There is one URL, and that URL always displays the "Welcome to My Store" page with a fixed list of categories and products. 

The Angular [router](guide/glossary#router) allows us to show different components and data to the user based on where the user is in the application. 

In the simplest form, the router takes the state of the browser's URL bar (also called navigation or location bar) and maps it to a set of components to render to the screen. When the user navigates to another part of the app (by performing application tasks or entering a new URL), the router swaps one set of components for another. 

In this section, you'll: 
* Learn about common types of routes
* Enable routing in the Store app
* Make the product list area routable, meaning that user actions in this area will change the URL, and changes to the URL will replace the contents of this area
* Create and configure new product details to be included in the product list area when a single product is selected

*JAF: I need a word like "routable"...is that right?*

In this section, we'll update the Store app to use routing for the product list area of the app. 
The top bar and side navigation will remain fixed, while the product list changes. 
The URL and product list will change together, based on the user's selections. 

### Types of routes

A "route" defines a mapping of a URL suffix (a path) to the parent component to display. 

Most applications include these common types of routes:

* Default routes for destination pages, such as the home page:

    ```ts
    { path: '', component: HomePageComponent }
    ```

* Static routes for defined pages, such as the About page: 

    ```ts
    { path: 'about', component: AboutPageComponent }
    ```

* Variable routes, which are determined at runtime, include a variable prefixed with a colon to designate substitution. Variable routes are useful for creating URLs that correlate to data values, such as product IDs. This is the type of routing we'll use for the product list. 

    ```ts
    { path: 'products/:productId', component: ProductDetailsComponent }
    ```

* Catch-all routes for error handling, such as displaying a 404 for non-existent pages. 

    ```ts
    { path: '**', component: PageNotFoundComponent }
    ```

These routes enable you to build simple to complex URLs to navigate around your application, based on the purpose and requirements of your application.


### Configure the app to use routing

So far we've worked mostly within individual components and services. 

Some Angular features, however, are global to the app and available at all times. Because routing is pervasive--the user can enter a new URL or take an action that causes a change to the URL--routing must be enabled and configured at the app level. 

*JAF: Need help with this.*

To add routing to an app: 

1. Import and register RouterModule.
2. Set up a RouterOutet as a placeholder to dislay routed components.


#### 1. Open app.module.ts

Open the `app.module.ts` file. 
This file contains the root module, which is loaded first by the app. 
Functionality that applies to the entire app is defined here. 

*JAF: Have we described this file before? I think we've only touched app.module.html, so we should introduce this file formally here.* 


#### 2. Import RouterModule

Import `RouterModule` from the `@angular/router` package into the `app.module.ts` file: 

<code-example header="src/app/app.module.ts (RouterModule)" path="getting-started/src/app/app.module.1.ts" region="router-module">
</code-example>


#### 2. Register RouterModule

In the `imports` array, add the `RouterModule.forRoot([])` method with an empty array. 
Configured routes will be stored in the array.

*JAF: Terminology. "configured routes" or "defined routes" or "route configurations"?*

<code-example header="src/app/app.module.ts (imports)" path="getting-started/src/app/app.module.1.ts" region="router-module-imports">
</code-example>

Your application is configured with Angular routing, but the template needs a placeholder where it renders routed components. 

*JAF: "configured with Angular routing" means the router is created and ready to listen?*


#### 3. Add a router outlet

Remember that we're going to use routing for the product list area of the app.
To do that, open `app.component.html` and
replace `app-product-list` with `routeroutlet`. 

<code-example header="src/app/app.component.html (Router outlet)" path="getting-started/src/app/app.component.html" region="router-outlet">
</code-example>

The router is ready to listen for changes in the browser URL, but you need to configure it with routes to transition from one set of components to the next.

*JAF: Is this a listening action, a writing action, or both via routeroutlet?*


### Create a route that shows product list

To register a route for the product list, it must be defined in the array of routes.

#### 1. Add a product list route

In the `app.module.ts` file, add an object to the array defined in `RouterModule.forRoot()` array with an empty string as the `path` and set the `ProductListComponent` as the `component`.

<code-example header="src/app/app.module.ts (Product list route)" path="getting-started/src/app/app.module.2.ts" region="product-list-route">
</code-example>

Now when you navigate to your example URL with only the `/`, the list of products is displayed.

*JAF: Screen shot? Or show URL?*

### Create a route for product details

To display more information for a particular product, you'll use a specific route for product details.

#### 1. Generate the product details route component

1. Right click on the `products` folder, use the `Angular Generator` and generate a component named `product-details`.

#### 2. Add a product details route

1. In the `app.module.ts` define a variable route for the product details. Use `products/:productId` as the `path`, with `productId` being substituted with the value from the URL, and `ProductDetailsComponent` for the `component`.

<code-example header="src/app/app.module.ts (Product details route)" path="getting-started/src/app/app.module.2.ts" region="product-details-route">
</code-example>

2. In the `ProductPreviewComponent`, update the template to link to the product details page with the `productId` using a `RouterLink`. 

<code-example header="src/app/products/product-preview/product-preview.component.html (Product preview routerLink)" path="getting-started/src/app/products/product-preview/product-preview.component.html" linenums="false">
</code-example>

When the user clicks on the product title, the router will navigate to the product details route, with the specific `productId`. Only placeholder text is displayed, but you'll retrieve the product details in the data section.



### How routing works

Navigation is done through the `RouterLink` directive provided by the `Router` in a template, or imperatively using the `Router` service. Navigation is always done by string, or by array of URL paths, such as `['path', 'to', variable]` which results in a URL that looks like 'https://example.org/path/to/42'.

*JAF: I don't understand what this is trying to say.*


#### Retrieving route information

To see information provided by the router for a routed component, each routed component is provided an `ActivatedRoute` service. You inject the `ActivatedRoute` service to access its route parameters, route data, and other necessary information. 

```ts
export class MyPageComponent {
  productId: string;

  constructor(private route: ActivatedRoute) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.route.paramMap.subscribe(params => {
      this.productId = params.get('productId');
    });
  }
}
```
*JAF: I think this is too deep without an example. Can we instead focus on the pattern of steps to take to set up routing?*

The route parameters and route data are provided as observables you subscribe to. When the parameters or data observables are updated, the observables produce a new value. The example below shows you how to subscribe to a route and get its `productId` provided through a variable route from its URL.

After you set up the router, you can continue to create more components and routes in your `RouteConfig`.
