## Assumptions


The Angular documentation assumes that you are familiar with:

* Basic programming
* HTML, CSS, and JavaScript or Typescript

More advanced or specialized information may assume additional prerequisite knowledge or experience. For example, the Animations guide assumes that you are familiar with web animation in general, and the guide focuses on building off that knowledge to create animations with Angular.
