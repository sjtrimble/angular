# Getting Started - Deployment

To deploy our application, we have to build it, and then host the JavaScript, CSS, and HTML on a web server. Built Angular applications are very portable and can live in any environment or served by any technology such as Node, Java, .NET, PHP, etc.

## Deploy from StackBlitz

1. On the left menu bar, click the `Firebase` icon.
1. If you donâ€™t have a `Firebase` account, visit the [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) to sign up for a free hosting account.
1. Click the `Sign into Google` button and follow the prompts to give `StackBlitz` access your `Firebase` projects
1. Select the `project` where you wish to deploy your application.
1. Click the `Deploy` button to deploy your application
1. Once deployment succeeds, click the `Open live site` link.

## Build locally

To build your application locally, you will need to download your source code. Click the `Download Project` in the left menu across from `Project` to download your files.

Once you have the source code downloaded and unzipped, use the [Angular Console](https://angularconsole.com) to serve the application, or you install Node and have the Angular CLI installed.

From the terminal we can install the CLI globally with:

`npm install -g @angular/cli`

This will install the command `ng` into our system, which is the command we can use to create new projects, serve our application during development, or produce builds that can be shared or distributed.

We'll want to create a new CLI project using:

`ng new my-project-name`

From there we can replace the `/src/app` folder with the one from our `StackBlitz` download, and then perform a build.

`ng build --prod`

This will produce the files that we need to deploy.

## Hosting our Files

The files in the `dist/my-project-name` folder are static and can be hosted on any web server capable of serving files (node, Java, .NET) or any backend (Firebase, Google Cloud, App Engine, others).

### Hosting an Angular app on Firebase

One of the easiest ways to get your site live is to host it using firebase.

1. Sign up for a firebase account on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).
1. Create a new project, giving it any name you like
1. Install the `firebase-tools` CLI that will handle our deployment using `npm install -g firebase-tools`
1. Connect your CLI to your Firebase account and initialize the connection to your project using `firebase login` and `firebase init`.
1. Follow the prompts to select the `Firebase` project you creating for hosting.
1. Deploy your application with `firebase deploy` because StackBlitz has created a firebase.json that tells Firebase how to serve our app.
1. Once deployed, visit https://your-firebase-project-name.firebaseapp.com to see it live!

### Hosting an Angular app anywhere else

To host an Angular app on another web host, you'll need to upload or send the files to the host, and because we are building a Single Page Application, you'll need to make sure you redirect any invalid URLs to your index.html file. Learn more about development and distribution of your application in the [Building & Serving](build) and [Deployment](guide/deployment) guides.

## Tutorial Finish

There are lots more advanced capabilities that Angular offers, but you now have the foundation that will allow you to build an application and to explore the other capabilities the Angular platform has to offer.

You finished the tutorial and are now an Angular developer! Feel free to [share this moment](#) or [tell us what you thought of our tutorial](#).
